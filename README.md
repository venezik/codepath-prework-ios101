# Prework - *IOS101-Preworks-Codepath*

Submitted by: **Yaroslav Petrunin**

**IOS101-Preworks-Codepath** is an app that... 
 - changes color of the background when the button is clicked
 - it also changes the color of the labels randomly, but calls the random function, so that the colors are generated separately and do not overlap for each individual label and is separate from background.
 - has a button and 3 labels.

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- [x] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color

Here is a reminder on how to embed Loom videos on GitHub. Feel free to remove this reminder once you upload your README.

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
1. Telegram - I am stunned how they were able to implement crypto platform within the messenger. Animated stickers is another great feature.
2. Instagram - My favorite feature of the Instagram is their UI&UX design, it makes it very smooth and enjoyable. I really enjoy the way stories are integrated with the ability to sync music.
3. Youtube - the visual breakdown of the moments when you try to fastforward is awesome. Also, their algorithms for suggested videos is awesome.

App Idea: I would like to build an app that would implement chat and connect with the GitHub so that you can discuss your project with another person in chat within the App. I would also like to implement features like Telegram has, where we can edit messages at any point or to delete it for both sides.
## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
-I had to learn how to navigate around the Xcode as well as how to implement color change for the labels. It did not want to work for me, but eventially I was able to solve it. Not being too familiar with the SWIFT syntax made it harder as well.
